#K# This command will set levels for the variable 'Status' and specify the order of the variables
#B# The main problem here is that we don't have any object called "Status" for 
#B# the function factor() to operate on. We do have a dataframe called 'data',
#B# and that has a column called 'Status', so we should use that. We can 
#B# access that column with data$Status, and we can update that column by
#B# putting data$Status on the left hand side of the assignment operator (<-)
#B# I pressed return after each , to make the line a bit shorter, 
#B# and the indenting makes it easier to read.
#B# I put space around the = to make it more readable.

#K# The bar plot is incorrect. Let's try to make a table.
#B# same problem as above...
#B# looks right to me!

#K# It's showing that there are 0 observations for each factor level. 
#K# I need to figure out what I'm doing wrong.

#B# it's better now :) I'm stopping here, because it looks like the lines below 
#B# were an attempt to get this plot that we saw above. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#This command will convert factors where the levels appear as numbers.
