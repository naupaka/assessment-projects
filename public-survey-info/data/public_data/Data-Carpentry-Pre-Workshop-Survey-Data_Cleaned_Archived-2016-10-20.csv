This depends upon correlating the characteristics (size, decoration, color) that define different types of beads, as well as the types of beads that appear together as necklace groups. Tracing the changing distributions of beads and bead-groups over time reveals the formation of trade networks that not only imported beads and raw glass (ultimately originating in the Eastern Mediterranean), but also exported—among other commodities—slaves captured during viking raids in the west.",1,3,4,,2,,,,,,,,,,3,2,2,5,4,3,3,"I hope that this workshop prepares me to gather the right data more efficiently, and that I'm ready to conduct rapid analysis both while researching and upon the completion of data collection.",1,2,2,,6,
