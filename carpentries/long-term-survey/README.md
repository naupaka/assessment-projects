# Summary
Data and Software Carpentry launched a [long-term assessment survey](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment-projects/blob/master/joint-carpentry-projects/long-term-survey/long_term_survey.pdf) in March 2017. The main goal of the resulting survey was to ask our learners to describe concrete changes they had implemented to their research practices as a result of completing a Carpentries workshop.
